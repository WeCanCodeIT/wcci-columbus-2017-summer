# Reviews Site, Full Stack

## Overview

Return to your reviews site from the [previous exercise](../reviews-site) (or create another).

We're going to add categories to reviews. Each category will have one or more reviews (a one to many relationship). Each review will be assigned to one category (a many to one relationship).

Also, we're going to JPA-enable your site so that it writes/reads from an H2 database.
