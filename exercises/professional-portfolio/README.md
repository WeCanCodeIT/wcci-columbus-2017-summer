# Professional Portfolio

## Overview

Create a portfolio site highlighting your work that can be shared with potential employers. Focus first on building a good structure that you can later style with CSS.

## Tasks

### Required Tasks

- Set up your *username*.github.io site as per the instructions at https://pages.github.com.

- Create a main page (`index.html`) representing a professional portfolio, including the following, styling each appropriately:

  - an appropriate `<header>` element
  - a `<nav>` element linking to each of the sections
  - a `<section>` element for each of the following, each of which should contain an appropriate heading (`<h1>`-`<h6>`) element:
    - *About Me*, consisting of:
      - brief biographical information
      - photo
      - contact information
      - links to your professional networking site profiles, including at least GitHub and LinkedIn
      - list of skills
      
      Include whatever other information you consider pertinent.

    - *Projects*, consisting of at least three, each represented as an `<article>`
      - name of project, linked to GitHub repository or the repository/project's GitHub Pages
      - screenshot
      - skills / technologies used

      Don't worry if your available projects are limited now. You'll have time to increase the size of your portfolio.

  - an appropriate `<footer>` element

  Any resources (images, etc) you use should be:
    - free for non-commercial use
    - copied to your repository and referenced there rather than via a uri pointing to another site

### Tips

- Give each section an id, and use that to create an anchor.
- See the appropriate Mozilla Developer Network reference pages for guidance regarding tag usage:
  - [&lt;header&gt;](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header)
  - [&lt;nav&gt;](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav)
  - [&lt;section&gt;](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section)
  - [&lt;article&gt;](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article)
  - [&lt;footer&gt;](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer)


### Stretch Tasks

- Ask back-of-the-room Brent to help you build a responsive layout using Bootstrap's grid system.
  - Stretchier task: Have front-of-the-room Brent help you create a responsive layout with Bootstrap before back-of-the-room Brent says "Bootstrap".

For real, though: research Bootstrap's grid system and try applying it to your site. See how it responds on a mobile device. Explore the Device Toolbar in Chrome to see how your site responds.
