## Tasks

### Required Tasks

Definition - What does Yak Shaving mean?

Yak shaving is a progranming term that refers to a series of tasks that need to be performed before a project can progress to its next milestone. This term is believed to have been coined by Carlin Vieri and was inspired by an episode of "The Ren & Stimpy Show." The term's name alludes to the seeming uselessness of the tasks being performed, even though they may be necessary to solve a larger problem. The process of complicating a simple activity also may be considered yak shaving.

## Details

For this assignment, you will be recreating the overall structure of some existing websites. You are _not_ going to be focusing on the look of them, though - instead, you're going to focus on the **structure**.

The structure of a document is determined by the HTML tags (elements) that make it up. In HTML5, much more emphasis is placed on using appropriate _semantic_ elements: that is, elements that convey some sense of how their contents fit with the rest of the content on the page.

Do not focus on what the page _looks_ like - instead, focus on what the parts of the page are intended to _convey_. In fact, feel free to use placeholder text anywhere there is an image or large blobs of text. Use the toolbox for ideas of tags to use.

Also don't get bogged down in the exact content - try to convey the gist of what the page is showing, but don't feel like you have to re-type _every single thing_ on it. The point of this assignment is to focus on the structure, not the content.

For each task, it might help to draw boxes around key areas and connect related areas.

### Toolbox

Here are some suggestions for tags to use. You aren't limited to these, but you should be able to complete the required tasks using these:

* `<!DOCTYPE html>`
* `<html>`
* `<head>`
* `<body>`
* `<header>`
* `<nav>`
* `<main>`
* `<article>`
* `<section>`
* `<aside>`
* `<footer>`
* `<h1>`...`<h6>`
* `<p>`
* `<ul>` and `<li>`
* `<ol>` and `<li>`
* `<img>`
* `<table>`
* `<div>`

### Stretch Tasks

Work on these additional layouts. These aren't necessarily more complex layouts - remember to focus on the information that needs to be conveyed, and trust that positioning/sizing can largely be handled with CSS!

## Hints

Your HTML pages will LOOK very different than the screenshots, but the content should be accessible in a similar way.

If you want to get some filler text, you can visit [Lipsum.com](http://www.lipsum.com/), or get some local flavor from [Bacon Ipsum](https://baconipsum.com/).

You can use Notepad to work on these files.
