## Topics

#### If/Else
- What are conditionals and why are they important in programming?
- What is the difference between an if statement and an if/else statement?
- When should an if or if/else conditional statement be used?
- What is the syntax for if and if/else statements?

#### Switch Case
- What is the difference between using if/else and switch/case statements?
- What is the syntax of a switch/case statement?

## Goals
- Students should know the syntax for if, if/else, and switch/case statements.
- Students should know when to use an if/else versus a switch/case statement.
- Students should be able to identify when a conditional statement is necessary to solve a problem

## Practice Problems

### Are they equal?

Ask the user for two integers. Check and see if the two integers are equal to each other. If they are, inform the the user that the numbers are equal; otherwise, inform the user that the numbers are not equal

#### Examples

```bash
Enter your first number:
16
Enter your second number:
18
The numbers 16 and 18 are not equal to each other.
```

```bash
Enter your first number:
42
Enter your second number:
42
The numbers 42 and 42 are equal to each other.
```

### Even or Odd?

Ask the user for a number. Tell the user if that number is even or odd. 

```bash
Enter a number:
15
15 is an odd number.
```

```bash
Enter a number:
42
42 is an even number.
```

### Positive or Negative?

Asks the user for a number, then tell the user whether that number is positive or negative. What happens when the user enters 0? Is it positive or negative?

### A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y

Ask the user for a character, and tell the user whether it is a vowel or a consonant. *Tip: You can solve this problem using a switch condition with only one break statement.*

### Greater of Two

Ask the user to input two integer values. Print the greater value.

Extension: ask the user for three integers, then print the greatest value.

### Don't Be Mean

Ask the user for four integers. Calculate the mean (average) of these and display the result.
