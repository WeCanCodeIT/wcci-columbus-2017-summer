## Tuesday, June 6

### Topics

- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

### Resources

- *Head Start Java*, Chapter 7: inheritance and polymorphism 

### Exercises

These are a bit open-ended, but that's ok.

- Imagine you have a fleet of delivery vehicles: vans, planes, bicycles, etc. How would you model these vehicles? Create your inheritance hierarchy (classes and subclasses).
	- Support attributes like the following:
		- vehicle description: number of wheels, make, model, number of passengers, etc
		- rate of travel: miles per hour
	- Include methods that, at a minimum:
		- tell how far the vehicle would travel given a certain length of time
		- calculate how long it would take to travel a certain distance
	- Stretch goals:
		- Factor a maintenance/rest/break period into your calculations (e.g a bicycle rider must rest a half hour every two hours)
		- Add attributes (instance varibles)/operations (methods) to allow for fuel consumption, efficiency, and refueling. How does this impact your human-powered vehicles?

- Imagine you are modeling the people that work at a software development company.
	- These people might include:
		- developers
		- managers
		- human resources
		- janitors
	- Build model(s) (or at least consider models) and how they would be different for applications that:
		- manage payroll (remember to consider hourly vs salaried employees)
		- manage project work, allocating the required hours per week for each role
